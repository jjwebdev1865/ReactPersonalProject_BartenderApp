# Bar Tender App - Justin

## Requirements can be solved however the developer wants; no UI requirements, so don't worry about making it pretty. Just don't use any external tools to solve; use React only.

## 1. Display beers from API -- names, price, image. This is the beer menu.

### API: https://api.sampleapis.com/beers/ale

## 2. Add a button to allow you to arbitrarily add another beer to the menu

### There is no API for adding beer; you are just adding it to this app. So just a simple textbox with a button. Type name of beer into text box, click button, new beer should appear in the menu on the screen.

## 3. Sometimes beers sell out. Add functionality to all for arbitrarily removing a beer from the menu.

## 4. Add functionality to allow a beer's name in the menu to be changed.

## 5. Add functionality to allow for creating a beer flight -- select up to six beers to add to this flight, and render the flight as a separate list on screen -- don't worry about the price and image, just show the name.
